# Code Challenge: React, Node & Mongo - Inventory
Here I do a simple csv upload, search &amp; delete page

To start please download this entire project structure.

You will also need to setup a local MongoDB server so you can host a connection for example this MongoDB connection uses:
mongodb://localhost:27017/inventory (inventory is the collections name) the rect is the service connection.
To make your own local MongoDB please go here and follow the steps: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
This wil show you a step by step on how to make your own local MongoDB. 

`You can start where it says "Run MongoDB Community Edition from the Command Interpreter"`

After setting the the server and getting the project up. 
run `npm install` on the project directory to install all the necessary React plugins.
after the installs you can simply type `npm run start` and this will start both ther server layer & the client layer. Now you are good to go.
